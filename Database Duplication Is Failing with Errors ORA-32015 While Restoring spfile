CAUSE
Bug 35801772
 
Symptoms match with the Bug which is in status 11 { Dev working }
 

SOLUTION
Action Plan which helped to resolve the issue given in the above Bug was :

If the spfile is specified within CRS on the auxiliary instance, this will cause the error for the spfile. Clearing it removes the issue.

Run the below command at the Auxiliary DB to confirm if spfile has been configured in CRS

$ srvctl config database -d oracldb
Database unique name: oracldb
Database name: oracldb
Oracle home: /ora01/oracle/db/19.3.0/db_home/

The above command showed that spfile setting was configured in CRS.

Clear the spfile setting in CRS using the below command : 

At the Auxiliary DB

========

$ srvctl modify database -d oracldb -spfile '' # it is two single quotes
